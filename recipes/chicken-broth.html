        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This isn't your traditional clear chicken broth. This broth is opaque, creamy, and richly flavored, 
            and ready for use in any recipe that calls for broth, or seasoned and drunk by itself. Modeled loosely after
            paitan ramen, a chicken broth made cloudy by the fat emulsified in it.</p>
